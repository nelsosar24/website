      <p>
        From May 2022, when I graduated college, to January 2023, I have
        traveled to 4 continents, 14 countries, and 15 states. This was a dream
        I didn’t think would be possible. So how did a deter from the typical
        societal route of college immediately to work?

        My Story of Traveling During my Gap Year: I went into college, always
        wanting to study abroad and spend an entire semester abroad. Well…2020
        and COVID had other plans. I was lucky enough that I took a giant leap
        of faith after my freshman year of college and went and lived in Hong
        Kong during summer break. After that, I still had a deep burning passion
        for traveling. So I was deeply excited to live in London during my
        junior year of college and study abroad. But, plot twist, everything got
        canceled. So going into my senior year, I accepted my full-time job to
        start in August 2022. That’s when one of my co-workers told me about the
        ability to waive our start date and begin in February 2023. So I emailed
        HR that day, and boom, my start date was changed. And that’s when the
        panic started. I had this deep desire to travel and experience the world
        before I started work but now what. I had 9 months and zero plans.
